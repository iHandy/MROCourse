    --><string name="main_text">When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim\'s warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping.

I prop myself up on one elbow. There\'s enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother\'s body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim\'s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me.

Sitting at Prim\'s knees, guarding her, is the world\'s ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. He hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I think he still remembers how think he still remembers how think he still remembers how think he still remembers how </string>
